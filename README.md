This notebook seeks to better-understand the world of pinball by researching and analyzing available data. Currently, it primarily uses the [Open Pinball Database](https://opdb.org/) to look at the number of machines produced and companies in the industry. 

In the future, I'd like to analyze machine popularity and scores by scraping pinball score logging applications, though Cloudflare is currently a problem.
